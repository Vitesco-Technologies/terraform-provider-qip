# Nokia QIP Provider

The provider for Nokia QIP will allow you to retrieve metadata from QIP or manage IPv4 addresses including their DNS names.

Features:

- Data sources for `qip_v4address` and `qip_v4subnet`
- Manage addresses with `qip_v4address`

Also see the Terraform module [qip-address](https://github.com/Vitesco-Technologies/terraform-module-qip-address),
which also can be found as [Vitesco-Technologies/qip-address on the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Vitesco-Technologies/qip-address/module/latest).

Build based on the Swagger API documentation that should be available with your QIP instance: `https://qip.example.com.com/rest-api/`
